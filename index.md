### Training Data Compliance for AI Teams

Brew-Freedom helps AI teams track, audit, and validate the compliance of training data **before models are deployed**.

## Why it matters
AI teams often lack visibility into licensing, provenance, and sensitive data risks in training datasets.

## What this demo shows
- Licensing risk detection
- Dataset coverage gaps
- Actionable remediation guidance
