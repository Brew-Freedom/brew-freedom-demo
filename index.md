### Training Data Compliance for AI Teams

Brew-Freedom helps AI teams track, audit, and validate the compliance of training data **before models are deployed**.

---

## The Problem
AI teams often lack visibility into what data was used for training, whether it is properly licensed, or if it includes sensitive or restricted content. This creates legal risk and slows deployment.

---

## The Solution
Brew-Freedom provides a centralized compliance layer that:
- Tracks training datasets and sources  
- Detects licensing and sensitive data risks  
- Flags deployment blockers early  
- Recommends remediation actions  

---

## Example Compliance Finding
**Partial Licensing Coverage Detected**
- Source: Public web crawl (2021–2023)
- Affected data: ~18%
- Risk: Commercial usage rights unclear
- Severity: Medium

**Recommended action:**  
Review licenses or replace affected data before production deployment.

## Data Module Demo
This project includes a **Training Compliance Checker** demonstrating how structured compliance data can be validated and surfaced automatically.
